            <h1> The Best news From Track and Field</h1>
            <p>Track and field, or athletics as it is called in many countries, is the designation
                given to contests for men and women that involve running, jumping for height and distance,
                and throwing for distance using implements of standardized design. Competitions in track and
                field are called meets and are usually held outdoors, with the running events taking place on a
                portion of or around a 400-m (437.2-yd) or 440-yd (402.3-m) oval made out of cinders,
                clay, or synthetic compounds.</p>

                    We can understand better how each of the lower body muscles contributes to sprint
                    running from studies that have performed biomechanical analyses of the joints and
                    muscles during running at various constant speeds,
                    including maximal speed sprinting.

            <h3>Conditioning</h3>
            <p>
                The genetic makeup of an athlete may bless him or her with natural speed,
                but without working on proper sprinting mechanics an athlete will never reach full potential.
                This means speed can be taught and all athletes have the potential to increase their speed.
