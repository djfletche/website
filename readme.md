# Website

I made this project in intellij. I am getting more familiar with the ins and outs of this editor.

## Getting Started
you need the pictures
the html 
and you need to have it set up together
you also do not need to  loose track of the css

### future development

I want to add more sections to the to the main page. I also want the website to pull from a database of infomration on the sprinting page.


```
```

## The Website
set everything up in your editor as it is branched in the repository a nd ou should be fine.

## Built With

* Intelli J IDE

I Used a lot of resorces and went to a lot of different websites to debug my issues. 
at the end of the project i was able to solve all of my issues. 


## Acknowledgments
* This code helped me learn more about Javascripts and setting up html websites
